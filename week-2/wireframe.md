Reflection
- What is a wireframe?
    - A wireframe is a basic blueprint of the overall design of the website. It is a great first step for brainstorming how you want it to look and how the user experience will be.
- What are the benefits of wireframing?
    - It provides a good blueprint for your overall design when you start using a more picturesque method of drawing out the imagery of the site. It removes the distraction of fonts and colors so that full focus can be on the layout. It’s very useful for seeing how the user will experience the site.
    - The tutsplus site describes it like the architecture of a building. We don’t want to worry about the wall colors what sofas we want. We want a basic structure at which to start building and fleshing out what is possible.
- Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
    - I actually did not because I am the type of personality that always tries to reinvent the wheel. So for a normal about me site I’d rather stay basic and simple.
- Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
    - I originally wanted to have a section on the left side as well as the right but I decided that it was a cleaner look to just have it on the right. I realize the page will end up being longer than it is wide so I’ll make use of that.
- What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
    - The question during my wireframe ended up being “What do I really want on this site?” Part of it was that I don’t just want this to be technical but I also want to share personal experiences. I realized that I could simply have a section on the side that shows blog topics.
- Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
    - Definitely the actually framing of the wires and boxes was tedious. I used Omnigraffle which I use to make flow charts for work. This had issues when I was trying to just make it look more presentable by having boxes in a sensible size structure.
