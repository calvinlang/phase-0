<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
	- It was surprisingly easy to know how things you type in an esoteric language will appear. It was nice because I was really pushing content and I could see that what I was doing was producing something very very quickly.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	- It was quick to implement and very straightforward. It does feel tedious at times because there are a lot of things one has to do multiple times. 
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
	- Not formatting was difficult because HTML is an easier syntax to work with and changes could be implemented so quickly it's difficult to stay away. 
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
	- I'm not sure I'm ready to answer that because I'm not totally certain what HTML gets used for in an web developer position. At this point it seems like a really good way to structure/wireframe a site. The bad part seems to me that in most web sites we will have many pages as part of it. It looks like it would be a lot of work if there are any changes to be made to have to make it to all of them.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	- I keep a document on my evernote with the basic structure of an HTML with the header and footer because those things are generally invisible and it's easier just to start an HTML file with that information already inside. Also with tables I have to remember that everything is always in rows. Rows rows rows!
