Reflection
- What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
    - Gather information

    - Design
    - Development
    - Testing and delivery
    - Maintenance
- What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
    - The primary goal is for me to update my thoughts and experiences. This will include my experiences at DBC, coding, and outside. This is a good opportunity for me to start blogging in general!
- What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
    - Mainly people who are looking for information in coding. But i also see it as a site for just general improvement and lifestyle. People looking for information on being a budding software developer will be the first step though.
- What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
    - I want them to see the list of topics on the blog and see what interests them. I’d like them to look at the projects I’m doing just for their own input.
- What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
    - Everything hinges to one main thing: how users perceive it. Does it give them value? It should not present obstacles for them in finding information or using the site as a resource.
- What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
    - It is the study of how design is used by the users. It’s valuable because the products being made are for the end user and UX explores the methods and designs that generate the best user experiences.
- Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
    - My sitemap image wouldn’t load. It took me a long time to get it to work. First I thought that it was a problem with syntax. And I would make changes, upload back to git and the image still wouldn’t show. I then tried HTML syntax and it wouldn’t work. So I put the image in the same directory as my design-reflection.md folder and linked to that. This worked. However after a lot more troubleshooting it turned out my file at relative path /imgs/site_map.jpg could be access on that reference on github. I checked the folder many many times. Instead I had to link it to /week-2/imgs/site_map.jpg even though the reflections file is in the week-2 folder. I still can’t figure out why this is the case.
