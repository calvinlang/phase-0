# What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?
# 	The most interesting part of this challenge was that I didn't want to stop adding to the complexity.
# 	I already spent about 2.5 hours on it and I thought it best to move on. The problem was that I had it working
# 	but I wanted to change how the information was held. I didn't want a big hash of every name with the group number.
# 	I wanted the information presented as Group 1: name, name, name. So my first thought was to make an array with
# 	each group as a position and the names as part of a sub array. This turned out to be a dead end. Then I tried using
# 	a method to convert my hash to another hash with the groups as keys and a list of names as the value. But then 
# 	it just ended up with the final name put in as the key. FRUSTRATION. So finally I ended it with an each loop
# 	within a while loop that just puts the names if they're in each group. Success!
# Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?
# 	Well the first part of simply giving each person a group assignment was easier, even if there were issues. 
# 	I tried to pseudocode the rest of it but I just ended up having methods that didn't work.
# Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?
# 	Since I am using random integers, there is a higher chance of every group not having 5 than having 5. 
# 	I couldn't figure out how to make it so that it would limit each group to a certain number of people.
# 	I was considering a loop that would repeat the process ad infinitum until it was randomly placed with a
# 	correct number of groups for each. It would be a lot easier if I knew how to automate the creation of variables.
# What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?
# 	I decided to store it as a hash with the student name as the key and the group number as the value. After this
# 	I attempted to make it into an array or subarrays but this ended up not working. However, I did manage to make the
# 	hash present as Group 1: then the names below. I originally wanted it to be as Group: name, name, name on a single
# 	line but I couldn't manage that and moved on.
# What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?
# 	I have a lot of trouble with refactoring. I think I don't know how to research this properly and I made some
# 	changes to make the work cleaner.
