<!-- 
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
	- I always return to the body and article because I think body includes everything. Article I keep coming back to because I think every page should have a content section clearly marked.
How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
	- Elements get laid out from the top left to right an down. The browser interprets from the top down on an HTML page. HTML should be written in sections in this order in order that standardize and not generate too many mishaps in the interpretation.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist? 
	- Learned that I can put snippets to largely decresase the time it takes to write some things that I have to write over and over such as the basic HTML bones. I don't think I'll use it just because I already use an app called text-expander which I use throughout my computer.
