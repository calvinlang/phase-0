- How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
	- It's a terrific tool that can help figure out formatting changes live without have to always save the file and refresh the browser. 
- How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
	- You can use them as objects and set the width and height in CSS.
- What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you - find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
	- Absolute is a set location within the section. 
	- Fixed sets it on the page and kind of floats within the page. If you have it at the bottom it will be visible on the page at the bottom even if the scroll on the browser is not at the bottom.
	- Static leaves the object in the normal flow. It is the default setting of an object.
	- Relative affects where an object would be compared to it's normal position in the flow.
- What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
	- Margin sets the distance between the object other objects around it
	- Padding also sets the margin but doesn't allow overlap between padding. This is the main difference between padding and margins
	- Border sets a visual frame around an object that doesn't affect the distance between the object and other objects
- What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
	- I liked the challenge. It was a different take on previous challenges and it really was a good impression of the basic ability of how one can modify outputs in CSS.
