# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

1. A shell is an interface to access and communicate with the Operating System. Bash is a type of shell and it is widely used and compatible with many systems.
2. There are a lot of advantages to me about working in GUI that is user friendly, and one of them is using cmd-z/undo when I put something in the wrong folder. It’s live ammo on that terminal.
..* Another part is the syntax. Like if I’m using grep -R with a |, I might not know where to put what syntax if there’s also an > append.
..* I also get confused whenever the is a syntax of a of when to use dashes like I went ahead to the github assignment and there were commands like “—“ or “-p” and “/.” that I couldn’t figure out.
..* I’m also somewhat confused about capitalization. Sometimes I see -r and sometimes -R and I’m not certain what the differences are for each usage.
3. Yes I managed to use all the commands but I have some flash cards made to try to memorize these.
4. The “ruby” function seems to be most useful to me because I can quickly run my programming and see if it works from the terminal. I am still having trouble formulating why it would be more efficient than my GUI but I think that will come with time. 
5. What each does:
pwd - Print working directory shows me where I am in my folder structure
..* ls - tells me what files are in my current directory
..* mv - move files or folders from one directory to another
..* cd - changes my directory that I am working on
..* ../ - it is used when describing a location that it is one directory below
..* touch - creates a new file
..* mkdir - creates a new folder / directory
..* less - it opens a file (like a text) into a viewer where I can scroll or go to next page. Better for viewing larger files
..* rmdir - remove a directory
..* rm - remove a file
..* help - provides help like a list of available commands that I can make.


# 1.3 Forking and Cloning

I would describe GitHub first in terms of someone using a normal computer with day to day tasks like using a finder, DropBox and Apple’s Time Machine. This was troubling for me as I was wondering the difference between creating a branch and forking. Forking is a way to create a clone when you are not a collaborator on a project. 
I start by explaining it’s like downloading a folder/files that someone e-mailed you onto your computer. Explain that you now have a copy you can modify as you like but it is not going to change the original e-mail version. Any changes will only be on your own version. I would take them to Github and show how to make a repository and explain that it’s like you’ve made a new folder to download. To show them how to fork it. I’d copy the link, open their terminal and load where they want to save it. Then I would use the command $git clone link. I’d open the finder and show them they now have a clone/copy on their computer to do as they wish. 
I’d explain the options that one can see what changes were made and “sync” them to the version online. Then I’d tell them the advantages of this that it’s like you’re saving over your DropBox file, but even better because you can track all the changes over time. Think Apple’s Time Machine but with DropBox cloud functionality!
My first struggle with this concept was figuring out the difference between cloning and forking. I google searched it and found it was relatively simple. Cloning is when you are not an assigned collaborator on a project. 
Other struggles I had were about basically conceptual. I had trouble understanding what Github was and it took learning what each syntax meant for me to grasp that it was basically telling me what needed to be synced doing it. Before this program I thought github was like a LinkedIn for developers but I see now its functionality is well beyond that. I found [GitRef](http://gitref.org/) to be a site that made the most sense to me. It explained concepts conversationally with a lot of analogies (my brain tends to think in analogies and I use a lot of pneumonics for memorization). It broke every command line down explaining its function and why it was used.
